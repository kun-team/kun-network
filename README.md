# What Is KUN #

***KUN relies on ERC20 to expand the ecological building as the center. Based on the ERC20
twin-turbine reform, KUN designs contracts in accordance with the smart/shard storage/chain
synchronization/pos mining mechanism and introduces KUN currency.***


# User Case #

### KUN Savings Agreement

***In the KUN digital banking ecosystem, saving money is an essential function. KUN will initiate a
savings agreement. KUN will provide a stable currency savings product protected by principal can
accept multiple token deposits and pay stable interest. In order to generate income, the KUN
storage protocol can lend deposits, and borrowers need to use POS assets that can be easily
implemented on the blockchain as collateral. Therefore, KUN's income in the savings field is
mainly driven by the block rewards of the POS blockchain.
The KUN savings agreement will implement the settlement agreement, that is, whenever the
loan is at risk, the borrower's collateral will be liquidated to protect the depositor's principal. In
KUN's savings system, all deposits do not need to be locked and can be withdrawn at any time.***
***Stabilize deposit interest rates by allocating the variable part of the lump sum reward to
depositors
We are different from the products on the market in several ways. We use the overall rewards
accumulated to the mortgage assets to stabilize the deposit interest rate; we set the benchmark
interest rate of the blockchain economy by integrating the block rewards of all major POS
blockchains; the agreement Defines the loan-to-value ratio (LTV) of each collateral, which
represents the ratio of the value of the collateral that can be lent. The borrowing capacity
determines the maximum amount of debt that can be accumulated in the account.
Using the KUN savings agreement, depositors can predict their own income based on the income
of their borrowers on the chain. A unique enabler of "income transfer" from borrower to
depositor. The interest rate is the average value of the income received by the borrower and is
weighted by the value of the collateral supporting each income.
At the same time, the clearing agreement implemented by the KUN Savings Agreement aims to
guarantee the depositors' principal. As long as all debts of the deposit are still over-collateralized,
the deposit is safe. The function of the clearing agreement is to maintain deposit security by
repaying debts that may violate mortgage requirements. The agreement uses a liquidation
contract whose task is to repay debts to repay high-risk loans in exchange for collateral and
liquidation fees. The contract also charges the borrower a passive premium, which is calibrated to
ensure full coverage of outstanding loans. The liquidation contract can be written and used by
anyone.
It is used when the loan needs to be liquidated as needed***

### KUN financial loan

***The spirit of decentralization to build a better financial ecosystem is very clear. A system that
anyone in the world can use. DeFi should be open source and without custodial rights: you are
the owner of the funds, and you are free to use it when you need it. On this basis, KUN initiated
credit entrustment, and depositors who have not used the borrowing capacity can entrust credit
lines to people they trust to earn additional interest.
Credit-guaranteed unsecured loans are loans with almost no collateral, using the idle borrowing
capacity of DeFi liquidity providers. For liquidity providers, unsecured loans provide a way to
increase passive income by borrowing interest rates to earn a premium. Borrowers accept higher
interest rates in return and get loans without providing collateral.
Credit delegation uses a combination of smart contract functions and peer-to-peer trust. In
addition to delegating credit to smart contracts, trust is also introduced when using credit
delegation to obtain liquidity from DeFi. The most important thing about credit is the belief that
the loan can be repaid. In order to avoid non-payment of loans, KUN uses OpenLaw to ensure the
repayment of credit-based loans. Usually, OpenLaw is used as a legal package to ensure that the
transaction is legally binding. Therefore, the DAO protocol is actually used in KUN's lending to
balance the market. OpenLaw is an interesting tool that allows users to sign agreements and
execute smart contract codes directly through their Ethereum wallet.
The vault is a debt wrapper built on KUN. Each vault allows users to set different commission
parameters, including the currency that the borrower can withdraw, the interest rate formula,
and the most important credit
limit. Through OpenLaw, all borrowing and lending parameters are completed using
programmable legal agreements, making the withdrawal and lending of funds easier.***

### KUN's insurance pledge system

***KUN will also establish a pledge system in which users can pledge contracts that they think can be
safely rewarded. This is an updated system that can increase rewards, improve the distribution
mechanism, cancel the queuing mechanism and reduce the lock-up time. The new system allows
the promise of multiple contracts to increase the potential rate of return and effectively improve
capital efficiency. At the same time, rewards and punishments will be shared according to the
pledge ratio in different contracts.
Work-Enter KUN users to have their own accounts. KUN deposit mortgage system risk assessment
module application-KUN collateral will ensure that you believe that smart contracts will be these
KUN mortgage loans. Believe that any smart security system contract will be bet on, buy smart
contracts on the system Insurance. You can hold KUN amount 10 times (equivalent to 10 times
leverage) bet on many different contracts to earn bonus.
The reward system means that users will get rewards from each security contract they promised.
The deposit may be destroyed. If a security incident occurs in the mortgage contract, the pledged
tokens will be destroyed.
KUN relies on the active bets of risk assessors to indicate good risks and bad risks. The more bets
you place, the more insurance contracts you can buy. Therefore, it is very important to
appropriately reward risk assessors. Therefore, the user will also increase the reward to the
punter from 20% of the insurance amount to 50%. The system not only increases rewards, but
also distributes rewards more evenly. Rewards will be distributed proportionally to any member
who purchases a specific contract.***

###  KUN's decentralized exchange

***A truly decentralized exchange, an automatic market maker system, based on algorithms,
provides higher liquidity and transaction depth, and reduces transaction costs. Open API
products support multiple transaction pools, share orders and liquidity. This is a future-oriented
decentralized exchange product. We envision convenient exchange between multiple assets in
the future, and use extremely low handling fees, even without handling fees. Every user can use
it easily, data can interact across chains, and transactions can also be completed across chains.***

### KUN's investment portfolio agreement

***We will launch an automated DeFi yield aggregator product, dedicated to solving the complexity
of the current AMM protocol, the inability to perceive liquidity mining tokens, and the need to
provide at least two tokens. We believe that as long as the agreement can bring value to users,
the market will help verify the product. Its working principle is mainly to automatically deposit
stable coins and conduct liquidity mining through multiple protocols such as AAVE, Compound
and dYdX, so as to earn higher returns for investors. No complicated operation steps or complete
technical knowledge is required, making investment easier.***

### KUN's DAO governance model

***DAO (Decentralized Autonomy Organization) is a decentralized autonomous organization. In
nature, for example, "bee colonies", "ant colonies", and "big geese flying south" are all natural
decentralized autonomous organizations. DAO is formed on the basis of community consensus
autonomously, that is, individuals make their own decisions and reach the organization's rules
through consensus, and all consensus rules are enforced through smart contracts. In this process,
no one can violate the consensus rules. Because once a smart contract is deployed to Ethereum,
it cannot be modified, abolished or deleted. DAO is a cooperative operation (cooperative game).
The so-called cooperative game is to benefit at least some people without harming anyone's
interests. It is more conducive to give full play to collective wisdom and provide security for the
blockchain revolution***

###  KUN's financing agreement

***We hope to provide a more secure decentralized auction platform and provide initial financing
support for some high-quality projects.***

1. ***Fund security: The currency is in your wallet, so don't worry about the platform running away
   with the money;
   Independent and open: anyone can publish projects on it to raise funds, as long as they feel
   that their projects are good enough, they can come without any cost;***
2. **Fairness and transparency: Because it is decentralized, the fundraising situation is all carried
   out on the chain, which can be seen by anyone and cannot be faked. Put an end to the tricks of
   centralized financing platforms, where the total amount of funds raised is fraudulent, and the
   questionta of good projects is eaten up by the platform. It is true that everyone can participate
   and everyone can get rich. **


##  Token Economy ##

***KUN is the general warrant of the Kunchain ecology, it is also a fuel, and it is also a certificate
 for community holders to vote. We follow the model of community autonomy and use the DAO
 model to let KUN play a vital role in community governance. At the same time, holding KUN will 
enjoy various benefits of ecological development, and can participate in liquid mining rewards. 
The most important thing is that we have created a concept of a universal token, which can be 
directly exchanged across chains. It is the real financial world that leads to defi and the bridge 
that defi shines into the real asset world.***
